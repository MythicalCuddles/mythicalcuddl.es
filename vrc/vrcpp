<size=30><b><u><color=red>Announcement from MythicalCuddles</color></u></b></size>

After some delibration and consideration, I have decided to step away from the VRCPP Discord Server for the time being. 

This may come as a shock to many people as there has been an exitus of a few of the members as well, however this has been a thought in my mind for a long time now.

It is nothing to do with the on-going changes to the staffing structure as I chose to step away from this role before the changes. 

I previously discussed this with Miserly and Zerod, where I just hadn't felt like part of the team, resulting in me having issues with other staff members.
Don't get me wrong though, it was a pleasure to work alongside some of the staff and get to know the community, however there are definitely some bad actors within the community which have assisted in my decision.
Whilst it had been a thought on my mind to leave for a long time now, it was because of some of the great people I've met on the server that made me decide to stick around.
I may return in the future and still hang around at game nights etc, however for the time being, I'm looking to distance myself from the Discord Server and community until change can be seen.

I wish the staff the best of luck with the direction they are looking to take the server in, and hope that the server continues to grow and benefit from the changes. 
A lot of work had been put into where the server is today, and I hope to return one day to good news that the server is stronger than it is.
