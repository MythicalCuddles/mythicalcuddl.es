<b><u><color=orange>Announcement</color></u></b>

We're aware that Quest users are not able to see the video player at the moment! 
In an upcoming update, we're planning on changing our Video Player from UdonVideoPlayer to ProTV in hopes to support our Quest friends. 
Please look out for this and report any issues to MythicalCuddles on Discord (@mythicalcuddles).


<b><u><color=#FF00BC>A message from MythicalCuddles</color></u></b>

After some delibration and consideration, I have decided to step down from my role as a Manager with the VRCPP. 
It has been a pleasure to work alongside the staff team and get to know the community. 
I'll be sticking around in the meantime to hang out and participate in some events, so I look forward to seeing you all out there in the games.
I wish the staff the best of luck with the direction they are looking to take the server in, and hope that the server continues to grow and benefit from these changes.
I'm not going to discuss any staff-related stuff and upcoming changes so please do not bother me with any questions relating to this. I'm sure that Mis and the others will share this in due-time.
Do not worry though! The world, videos and other content is not going anywhere and will still be available for you to enjoy!

  ● Changed the roles on the Staff and Supporters board. This is to be updated in-line with the new changes being brought to the server and will be updated again.
  ● Fixed videos not loading in the video player. The video player should now display all episodes available in the Discord Server.
  ● Modified staff list authorized to use the megaphone. Megaphone can be picked up by anyone but will only work for any staff at Management Level. This will be modified in the future to also allow for Event staff to use the megaphone.
