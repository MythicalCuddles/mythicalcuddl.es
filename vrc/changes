<color=yellow>VERSION 1.00.002</color>  |  <color=green>02-JUL-2023</color></u></b>

  ● Resolved the problem where players sent to ban jail were clipping through 
    the floor and caught in an endless falling loop.

  ● Moved the ban jail closer to origin, so that the VRC menu could be used
    without problems (known floating point error that occurs at far distances
    from the origin point 0,0,0).

  ● Revamped the way that the Ban Player Prefab works.

  ● Text file can now contain the infraction type that the player committed.

  ● Players listed in the text file will have a banner placed over their head
    showing their infraction.

  ● Added an option to just have players on the list sent to jail directly
    (do not recommend).

    for an offense, as well as the offense they've committed.


<color=yellow>VERSION 1.01.005</color>  |  <color=green>14-SEP-2023</color></u></b>

  ● Re-wrote the User Offense system.  Instead of using pre-programmed
    Offense Codes, the world builder can define the Offense Codes, the title
    of the Offense, the color associated with the offense, and whether the 
    player is banned or muted under an offense.

  ● Improved the banned player containment system.
